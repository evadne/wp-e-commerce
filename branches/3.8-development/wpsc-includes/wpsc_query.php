/**
 * WP eCommerce query class and product display functions
 *
 * This is the wpsc equivalent of the wp query class, needed for the wpsc templates to work
 * The Cart class handles adding, removing and adjusting items in the cart, and totaling up the cost of the items in the cart.
 * The Cart Items class handles the same, but for cart items themselves.
 *
 * This code contains modified methods from the wp_query object of WordPress, located in wp-includes/query.php, these parts are to do with the loops we use that mirror the functionality of the wordpress loop
 * As such, they can be used in the same way, if needed.

 * @package wp-e-commerce
