Copy the contents of the zip file (a folder called gold_cart_files) into the wp-shopping-cart folder. Now it should automatically display a new tab called gold options, once you have entered in your API key all of the additional gold features will unlock.

If it does not appear straight away you might need to deavtivate and then reactivate the e-commerce plugin.

Please report any problems in the forums.
